# The "AdvancedAssign3" Folder
This folder contains the code for this assignment. As mentioned in the assignment instructions and in class, this code isn't meant to run, it is meant to show how REST naming conventions, and how to make a database schema. As a result, my naming conventions are proper, having plural nouns for getting things from the database. I have also linked the different tables for Receipts, Orders, and Products using relationships that make sense. For example, a Receipt and an Order have a one to one relationship since an Order can only have one Receipt and vise versa.
